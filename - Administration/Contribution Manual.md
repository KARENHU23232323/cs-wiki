- A link can be in the form of supplementary link (enclosed within brackets as supportive information), or implicit link (embedded text link). 

## Footer Area

- **Back to parent node**
    - When organising nodes in hierarchical approach, nodes should include a "Back to parent node: <parent_node>" that points the current node to the super node in the domain hierarchy.
- **Assumed knowledge**
    - List any assumed knowledge using footnote.
- **Tags**
    - Tags are denoted by keywords that identify a node.
    - Tags are in order of their significance level, formatted using snake_case to separate words.
