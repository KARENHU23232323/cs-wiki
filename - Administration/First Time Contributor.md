Hi there! To help you as a first time contributor, this page has important information about how to setup everything and make your first Pull Request. Follow along this page to find out the details.

# Guide to Obsidian

This wiki is developed on Obsidian, a powerful knowledge base application that enables a seamless exploration of interconnected concepts.

As a contributor, you are encouraged to use Obsidian for creating and editing contents. You can download Obsidian for your preferred platform from the official website [Download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)

Once you have the software on your device, you will learn how to use Obsidian markdown and other editing techniques from the [Obsidian Offical Documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Home).

If you don't have time to go through every detail, it is recommended you understand the formatting skills.

# Setup Your Local Vault

>[!IMPORTANT]
>It is expected that you understand the Git workflow.

1. **Fork the vault**  
    To contribute your bit, you will fork the vault from our wiki's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kkkkang-a/cs-wiki) and clone it to your local device.
2. **Open the vault in Obsidian**  
    To access the vault in Obsidian, open the Obsidian application, choose the "Open folder as vault" option. Next, you will locate the Advanced-Computing-Wiki vault you just downloaded on your device.
3. **Start editing**  
    While you can make minor changes such as typo corrections or small edits directly through the GitHub web page, it is important to work within Obsidian to allow the help of live preview and text formatting autocompletion features to keep your content consistent and error free.

# Submit Your Changes

Follow theses steps to submit your changes.

1. **Commit and push your changes**  
    Once you finish your editing, commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
2. **Open a new Pull Request (PR)**  
    When you have completed a full commitment or made a progress, create a pull request on GitHub. If there is no other notice, you can choose to merge your updates into the `main`branch. Meanwhile, please write a brief message regarding the update in the PR. 
3. **Review changes**  
    Carefully review your changes, check for anomalies and make sure your updates align with [ guidelines](Contribution%20Manual.md).
4. **Create PR and await approval**  
    Click the "Create pull request" button and your contribution will soon be reviewed by the wiki maintainers. Once your contribution passes the review, it will be reflected in our wiki main branch as well as the Obsidian publish website.
