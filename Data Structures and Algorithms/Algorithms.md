Algorithms are sets of instructions used to solve a problem.

To represent an algorithm in code, [Pseudocode](./Pseudocode.md#) is used.

# Analysis of Algorithms

## Correctness

Correctness requires a formal proof that the algorithm solves the problem.

## Complexity and Efficiency

Efficiency gives information about the expected behaviour of the
algorithm and is useful for making predictions and comparing
different algorithms. It bounds the algorithmâ€™s worst-case performance.

An algorithm is efficient if it runs in polynomial time.
