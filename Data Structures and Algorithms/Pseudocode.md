Pseudocode isÂ a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm should do.

It is written in a formal yet readable style that uses a natural syntax and formatting so it can be easily understood by programmers and others involved in the development process

# Syntax

Pseudocode does not have a particular fixed syntax. It is more like a code-like way of explaining what we do. The so-called style of your pseudocode can be C-like, Python-like or Java-like.

- if ... then ... else ...
- while ... do ...
- repeat ... until ...
